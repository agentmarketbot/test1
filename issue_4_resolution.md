# Resolution for Issue #4: Spec Definition

## Suggestions for Resolution

1. **Clarify the Scope and Features:**
   - Ensure that the initial scope is well-defined and achievable. Focus on core functionalities like prompt input, routing diagram definition, AI service interaction, and output handling.
   - Clearly differentiate between initial features and stretch goals to manage development priorities effectively.

2. **User Interface and Experience:**
   - Prioritize the development of a user-friendly text-based editor for routing diagrams, as the visual editor is a stretch goal.
   - Implement clear execution controls and status indicators to enhance user experience.

3. **Technical Design and Architecture:**
   - Use Chrome Extension APIs effectively for managing tabs, scripting, and storage.
   - Implement robust error handling to manage network errors, website changes, and incorrect routing diagrams gracefully.

4. **Security and Privacy:**
   - Plan for secure storage of sensitive data, such as API keys, even if it's a future enhancement.
   - Minimize permissions requested by the extension and be transparent about data access.

5. **Open Issues and Challenges:**
   - Develop a strategy for maintaining the extension in response to changes in the UI and HTML structure of AI services.
   - Consider implementing a mechanism to handle rate limiting and CAPTCHAs.

6. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Outline a roadmap for future enhancements, such as API key integration, conditional logic in routing diagrams, and support for more AI services.

7. **Success Metrics:**
   - Define clear success metrics to evaluate the extension's performance and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion

By addressing these points, the development team can ensure a successful implementation of the "AI Routing Assistant" extension.
